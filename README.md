**Please take note that these aspects are not finished:**

-Books stacked on top of hand (will be colored in and have names of court cases on them) 

-Head piece (will be colored in)

-Hair (will be colored in and possibly add on a bun for RBG's signature look)

-Head and arm (will be retraced in black, currently gray)

-Face (nose will be added and possibly earrings for RBG's signature look)

*In general, I have a lot of work to do on making the statue look more like RBG.

**OVERALL,** this is meant to depict the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the Statue of Liberty. This is a political visual argument, stating that the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett would destroy the work RBG has done for women's rights. Thus, the words "Here lies Ladies' Liberty" below the statue. I chose the words "Ladies' Liberty" to serve as a callback to Lady Liberty/ the Statue of Liberty. 

Some things I'd appreciate advice on: 
-How I can make her look more like RBG? Should I add actual text that indicates it is her?
-Any notes if there should be a background?
