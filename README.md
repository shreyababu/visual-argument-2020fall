**The main .xcf file is called Destroying RBG.xcf !**

**OVERALL,** this piece is meant to depict the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the Statue of Liberty. This is a political visual argument, stating that the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett would destroy the work RBG has done for women's rights. Thus, the words "Here Lies Ladies' Liberty" are written below the statue. I chose the words "Ladies' Liberty" to serve as a callback to Lady Liberty/ the Statue of Liberty. The book RBG holds by her side reads "My Most Fervent Wish," indicative of her final words, which were to not appoint her replacement on SCOTUS until a new president was elected. The books she holds on top of her palm are some cases in which she was influential in fighting for women's rights. The top case, Roe v. Wade, was not ruled on by RBG herself as it was before her time on SCOTUS, but it is representative of the abortion rights that RBG guarded; these rights are the most vulnerable if Barrett would be to appointed, which is why it has a place on the top of the stack.

Most of this piece was drawn by me, and I really enjoyed adding in details to add to the symbolism and aesthetic. I hope you all enjoy it!
